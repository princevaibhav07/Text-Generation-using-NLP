# Text Generation using NLP and Transformers

This repository contains the code and resources for a Text Generation project as part of my #MissionJobReady journey. The project demonstrates the use of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Transformer-based models to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can generate meaningful text based on user input prompts. Text generation models have a wide range of applications, including:

Content creation (e.g., articles, stories, and poetry).

Conversational AI and chatbots.

Personalized recommendations.

Creative writing support.

This project leverages state-of-the-art Transformer models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to achieve high-quality text generation.

## Features

Accepts custom prompts as input.

Generates contextually accurate and human-like text.

Supports adjustable parameters for text length, creativity (temperature), and repetition penalty.

Fine-tuned on specific datasets for enhanced results.

### Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Frameworks & Libraries:

TensorFlow

NLTK (for preprocessing)

Development Environment: Colab Notebook

## Dataset

Dataset used for training the model: [(https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-0.txt)].

Preprocessing techniques: Tokenization, stopword removal, and custom preprocessing for specific tasks.
